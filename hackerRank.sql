SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N), 2), ROUND(SUM(LONG_W), 2) FROM STATION;
-> ROUND(SUM(LAT_N), 2): This part calculates the sum of values in the LAT_N column and then rounds the result to two decimal places. The ROUND function takes two arguments: the value you want to round (SUM(LAT_N) in this case) and the number of decimal places (2 in this case). This part of the query calculates the sum of latitude values in the STATION table and rounds it to two decimal places.



SELECT ROUND(LAT_N, 4) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345 ORDER BY LAT_N DESC LIMIT 1;
->ORDER BY LAT_N DESC: This orders the filtered rows in descending order based on the LAT_N column. This means that the rows with higher LAT_N values will appear first.
LIMIT 1: This restricts the result to only one row, which will be the first row after sorting in descending order.
